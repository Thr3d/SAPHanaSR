.SH DESCRIPTION
SAPHanaSR-showAttr shows Linux cluster attributes for SAP HANA system replication automation.
The overall system replication (SR) state is shown as well as the HANA state on each node. If the HANA srHook method srConnectionChanged() is configured, the respective information is shown as well.
The information is fetched from the Linux cluster information base (CIB), not from HANA directly.
.PP
The output shows the following section:

Some fields are generated dynamically from the CIB. That fields might be missing,
if no corresponding attribute exists, e.g. the standby field.
An incomplete compilation on field details and purpose follows below.
.\" TODO formatting below. better no indents, but bold item header?
.PP
.B Hosts
- Linux hostname

Value: [ \fIHOSTNAME\fR ]
.\" TODO details. SAP allows up to 13 characters, SAP note. See also field vhost.
See also the  fields remoteHost and vhost.
.PP
.B clone_state
- state of the Linux cluster resource

Value: [ PROMOTED | DEMOTED | UNDEFINED | WAITING4PRIM | WAITING4NODES | WAITING4REG ]

.\" TODO: what kind of attribute?
This variable is set by the SAPHana resource agent.
.br
PROMOTED marks the master state of the instance, wich makes a HANA SR primary.
.br
DEMOTED makes a HANA SR secondary.
The DEMOTED state can be transient, on the way to promoting.
.br
WAITING4PRIM indicates potential risk of a dual primary situation. See section
DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT of ocf_suse_SAPHana(7) and ocf_suse_SAPHanaController(7).
.PP
.B lpa_lpt
- last primary timestamp

Value: [ \fIUNIX_EPOCH\fR | 30 | 10 ]

The node attribute lpa_<sid>_lpt is set by the SAPHana resource agent.
When the RA detects a running HANA SR primary on the node, it records the Unix Epoch time.
See section DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT of ocf_suse_SAPHana(7) and ocf_suse_SAPHanaController(7).
.br
Auxiliary values are set for an HANA SR secondary. 30 means the instance is
evictable for primary. 10 means: not yet ready.
.PP
.B node_state
- state of the Linux cluster node

Value: [ online | offline ]
.\" TODO UNCLEAN | pending ?
.PP
.B op_mode
- HANA SR operations mode

Value: [ logreplay | delta_datashipping | logreplay_readaccess ]

The node attribute hana_<sid>_op_mode is set by SAPHanaTopology, according to the running HANA. The attribute is used by the SAPHana resource agent for setting up system replication. delta_datashipping is not recommended in the context of Linux clusters.
.PP
.B remoteHost
- HANA SR remote host

Value: [ \fIHOSTNAME\fR ]
.\" TODO [ \fIHOSTNAME\fR | \fIHANA_VIRT_HOSTNAME\fR ] ?

The node attribute hana_<sid>_remoteHost is set by SAPHanaTopology, according to the running HANA.
The attribute is used by the SAPHana resource agent for setting up system replication.
See also the fields Hosts and vhost.
.PP
.B roles
- actual and configured roles for HANA on that node

The roles field in the Hosts section has up to six sub-fields.
.br

Field 1: return code
.br
Value: [ 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 ]
.br
.\"TODO This variable is determined by
This parameter does not tell you if the secondary system is ready for a takeover.
The meaning is different from common Linux return codes.
.br
4 = OK - Everything looks perfect on the HANA primary.
.br
3 = WARNING - A HANA Host Auto-Failover is taking place.
.br
2 = INFO - The landscape is completely functional, but the actual role of the host differs from the configured role.
.br
1 = DOWN - There are not enough active hosts.
.br
0 = FATAL - Internal script error, the state could not be determined.
.br
see landscapeHostConfiguration.py
.br

Field 2: HANA SR role
.br
Value: [ "P"rimary | "S"econdary ]
.br

Field 3: NameServer Config Role
.br
Value: [ master1 | master2 | master3 | worker | slave | standby | shtdown ]
.br

Field 4: NameServer Actual Role
.br
Value: [ master | slave | standby | shtdown ]
.br

Field 5: IndexServer Config Role
.br
Value: [ master1 | master2 | master3 | worker | slave | standby | shtdown ]
.br

Field 6: IndexServer Actual Role
.br
Value: [ master | worker | slave | standby | shtdown ]
.br

The sub-fields 3-6 are primarily useful for HANA scale-out.
.\" scale-out: master1:master:worker:master | master1:slave:standby:standby | :shtdown:shtdown:shtdown | ... [ master1 | master2 | master3 | worker | slave | shtdown ]
For scale-up that four fields should be master1:master:worker:master.
.\" TODO or ":shtdown:shtdown:shtdown"
.PP
.B score
- actual master score on that node

Value: [ 150 | 140 | 100 | 90 | 80 | 60 | 0 | -1 | -INFINITY ]
.\" TODO Value: for scale-out

This is a variable of the SAPHana resource agent. It is calculated based on an internal
scoring table. A value of 150 should cause the Linux cluster promoting the local resource
instance to HANA SR primary. This field should not be empty.
.PP
.B site
- HANA site where the host sits

Value: [ \fIHANA_SITE\fR ]

The node attribute hana_<sid>_site is set by SAPHanaTopology, according to the running HANA.
The attribute is used by the SAPHana resource agent for setting up system replication.
A dash (-) indicates the RA did not run or did not recognize the site.
.PP
.B srmode
- HANA SR mode

Value: [ sync | syncmem ]

The node attribute hana_<sid>_srmode is set by SAPHanaTopology, according to the running HANA.
The attribute is used by the SAPHana resource agent for setting up system replication.
SAP HANA knows also async and fullsync (see URLs below).
Those do not make sense for automating HANA system replication by an Linux cluster.
.PP
.B standby
- maintenance state of Linux cluster node

Value: [ on | off ]

This is a Linux Cluster node attribute. It is set by an admin.
The attribute is shown after it has been changed from the default.
The field might appear or disappear, depending on cluster maintenance tasks.
.PP
.B sync_st
and \fBsync_state\fR
- HANA SR status

Value: [ SOK | SFAIL | SWAIT | PRIM ]

.\"TODO cluster property sync_state ?
The cluster property sync_state is set by the SAPHana resource agent.
The first three values are representing an HANA system replication status,
recognized at latest RA run, see ocf_suse_SAPHana(7) and systemReplicationStatus.py .
.br
The 4th value (PRIM) just indicates an HANA SR primary.
.\".PP
.\"TODO \fBsrHook\fR
.\"
.\"Value: [ SOK | SFAIL | SWAIT ]
.\"
.\"The cluster property hana_<sid>_site_srHook_<site>
.PP
.B version
- HANA version

Value: [ \fIHANA_VERSION\fR ]

.\"TODO set by ...
Version of the HANA instance on that node. Of course, should be supported for
the given Linux version.
Should be same on all nodes, except during specific HANA upgrade procedure.
.PP
.B vhost
- HANA virtual hostname

Value: [ \fIHANA_VIRT_HOSTNAME\fR ]

The virtual hostname is used by the HANA instance instead of Linux hostname.
The node attribute hana_<sid>_vhost is set by SAPHanaTopology, according to the running HANA.
The attribute is used by the SAPHana resource agent for setting up system replication.
See also the  fields Hosts and remoteHost. SAPHanaToplogy needs the SAPHOSTAGENT to map from the local
hostname to the HANA virtual hostname.
.\" TODO details, see HANA global.ini
